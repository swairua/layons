## How to Integrate

### Step 1: Add to Admin Dashboard

```typescript
import { AuditManagement } from '@/components/AuditManagement';

export function AdminDashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
      <AuditManagement /> {/* All audit components in tabs */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Add Route

```typescript
import { AuditLogs } from '@/pages/AuditLogs';

// In your router configuration:
{
  path: '/admin/audit-logs',
  element: <AuditLogs />,
  requiresAuth: true,
}
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation Link

```typescript
// In your navigation menu:
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<nav>
  <Link to="/admin/audit-logs">
    üìä Audit Logs
  </Link>
</nav>
```

---

## Data Structure

All components work with the `audit_logs` table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  company_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action VARCHAR(50) CHECK (action IN ('delete', 'create', 'update', 'restore')),
  entity_type VARCHAR(100),
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  entity_name VARCHAR(255),
  entity_number VARCHAR(100),
  details JSONB,
  deleted_data JSONB,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

---

## Styling

All components use Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components:

- Cards, Badges, Buttons
- Tables, Dialogs, Tabs
- Select dropdowns, Input fields
- Responsive grid layouts
- Charts via Recharts library

---

## Chart Libraries

Components use **Recharts** for visualization:

- BarChart (daily activity, entity types, user activity)
- PieChart (action distribution)
- Responsive containers for mobile/desktop

---

## Time Series Data

Dashboard automatically generates daily activity data:

```typescript
const dailyData = [
  { date: 'Jan 01', delete: 5, create: 10, update: 3, restore: 1 },
  { date: 'Jan 02', delete: 3, create: 8, update: 5, restore: 0 },
  // ...
];
```

---

## Search & Filter Performance

Components optimize queries:

- Filter before rendering (1000 record limit in queries)
- Indexed database columns
- User data cached via React Query
- Memoized calculations

---

## Example Use Cases

### Monitor Deletions
Use **DeleteAuditLog** tab to:
- Track what users are deleting
- Review deleted data for recovery
- Identify deletion patterns
- Ensure compliance with deletion policies

### Activity Tracking
Use **AuditDashboard** to:
- Understand daily usage patterns
- Identify power users
- Track creation vs. deletion ratios
- Monitor system activity trends

### Compliance Audits
Use **AuditTrailViewer** to:
- Generate audit reports
- Track specific user actions
- Verify data protection compliance
- Identify suspicious patterns

### Incident Investigation
Use **All Tabs** to:
- Track who did what and when
- Review network information (IP)
- Understand sequence of events
- Recover deleted data

---

## Troubleshooting

### Components Not Showing Data
1. Verify user has admin role
2. Check company_id is set
3. Verify audit_logs table exists
4. Check RLS policies are correct

### Missing User Names
1. Verify profiles table is populated
2. Check profile.company_id is set
3. Ensure user_id references are valid

### Performance Issues
1. Check database indexes exist
2. Limit time range to smaller windows
3. Archive old audit logs quarterly
4. Monitor audit_logs table size
