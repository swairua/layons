## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Centralized Infrastructure (DONE)
- ✅ Created `src/utils/auditedDelete.ts` with:
  - `performAuditedDelete()` - single record delete with audit
  - `performAuditedDeleteMultiple()` - multiple records delete with audit
  - Helper functions for IP and user agent collection

### Phase 2: Update hooks with centralized delete calls
- [ ] Update useDatabase.ts (10 delete functions)
- [ ] Update useCreditNotes.ts (1 delete function)
- [ ] Update useCreditNoteItems.ts (2 delete functions)
- [ ] Update useQuotationItems.ts (1 delete function)
- [ ] Update useProforma.ts (3 delete functions)

### Phase 3: Update pages/components
- [ ] Update FixedBOQ.tsx (1 delete operation)
- [ ] Update forceTaxSetup.ts (1 delete operation)
- [ ] Verify Invoices.tsx, BOQs.tsx, Quotations.tsx audit logging

### Phase 4: Add database-level triggers
- [ ] Create database trigger on customers table
- [ ] Create database trigger on credit_notes table
- [ ] Create database trigger on invoices table
- [ ] Create database trigger on quotations table
- [ ] Create database trigger on proforma_invoices table
- [ ] Create database trigger on lpos table

### Phase 5: Create audit viewing UI
- [ ] Create DeleteAuditLog component
- [ ] Add audit log filtering and search
- [ ] Display deletion history in admin panel

### Phase 6: Testing
- [ ] Test each delete operation
- [ ] Verify audit logs are created
- [ ] Test cascade deletes
- [ ] Test error scenarios

---

## Audit Log Structure

Each delete operation will create an audit log entry with:

```json
{
  "id": "UUID",
  "company_id": "UUID",
  "user_id": "UUID",
  "action": "delete",
  "entity_type": "EntityName",
  "entity_id": "UUID",
  "entity_name": "Optional name",
  "entity_number": "Optional number",
  "details": {
    "deletedAt": "ISO8601 timestamp",
    "deletedBy": "User name or email",
    "tableName": "Table name",
    "whereKey": "Column name",
    "whereValue": "ID value"
  },
  "deleted_data": { "Full record data": "..." },
  "ip_address": "User IP",
  "user_agent": "Browser user agent",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Compliance & Best Practices

✅ **What We've Implemented**
- Centralized delete utility with consistent logging
- User tracking (user ID, name, email)
- IP address logging
- User agent logging
- Full record backup in `deleted_data` field
- Timestamp recording
- Cascade delete tracking

✅ **What Should Be Verified**
- All delete operations go through audit logging
- Deleted data is properly captured
- RLS policies allow audit log inserts
- Audit logs are immutable (no delete/update on audit_logs)
- Proper retention policy for audit logs

---

## Database Trigger Example (Optional)

For critical tables, add triggers to enforce audit logging at the database level:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_delete_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM log_audit_event(
    OLD.company_id,
    auth.uid(),
    'delete',
    TG_TABLE_NAME,
    OLD.id,
    OLD.name,
    OLD.number,
    jsonb_build_object(
      'deletedAt', NOW(),
      'trigger', true
    ),
    to_jsonb(OLD)
  );
  RETURN OLD;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Apply to critical tables
CREATE TRIGGER invoice_audit_delete BEFORE DELETE ON invoices
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_delete_trigger();
```
